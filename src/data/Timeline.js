        details: "I currently have a hyperfixation on Neural Networks, as I am now developing my own boilerplate functionality of a simple network in Rust. The popularization of the very well performing and 'friendily-compiled' systems language made me curious as to how it would behave when given deep learning tasks. My OOP brain also just loves the language for CodeGolf (it was tired of learning 05AB1E).",

I was gifted a DIY RFID breadboard set by my best friend, which is where I discovered how much fun microelectronics and digital logic can be. I began working on an 8-bit computer made of Texas Intrument IC and breadboards, which I still develop in my free time.',
